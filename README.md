# Lights Out

This is a simple Lights Out game, implemented in React and deployed on [Github Pages](https:lactantius.github.io/react-lights-out).

The initial board state is not completely randomized; instead it starts with all lights out, then randomly selects several squares to switch, ensuring that every game is solvable.

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Convert to TypeScript
- [ ] Add form with options for board size and number of lights on initially
